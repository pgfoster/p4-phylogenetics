# The advantage of using the p4 script is that it takes command line
# args, so you can read in data files and scripts, and p4 will try to
# deal with them sensibly.  Generally I assume that args to the p4
# command are file names.  But what if you want to hand p4 some args
# that are not file names?  That is fine, as long as you separate them
# by a double dash, ie
#    p4 aFile anotherFile -- 23 57
# and then they get put in var.argvAfterDoubleDash, (as strings, of
# course).

# The python 2 docs say """As initialized upon program startup, the first item of
# this list, path[0], is the directory containing the script that was used to
# invoke the Python interpreter. If the script directory is not available
# (e.g. if the interpreter is invoked interactively or if the script is read
# from standard input), path[0] is the empty string, which directs Python to
# search modules in the current directory first. Notice that the script
# directory is inserted before the entries inserted as a result of PYTHONPATH.
# 
# A program is free to modify this list for its own purposes."""

# So when a python script is run, the path to that script is made sys.path[0],
# but that is not appropriate in this case.  What the user would rather have is
# to search for modules in their current directory first.  So I put sys.path[0]
# back to being an empty string, the way it usually is when you run interactive
# python.

# Cymon seems to think this is needed to pull in the correct libraries:
# sys.path = [os.path.dirname(sys.path[0])] + sys.path
sys.path[0] = ''
