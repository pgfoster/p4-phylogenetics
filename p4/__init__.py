"""Maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analysis.

P4 is a phylogenetic toolkit that does Bayesian and maximum likelihood
phylogenetic analyses of molecular sequences.  It's specialty is that
you can use heterogeneous models, where the model parameters can
differ in different parts of the tree, or over different parts of the
data.

The package comes with-
   - the package itself, which goes where the third-party modules go,
     eg /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/p4/
   - the p4 script, which goes somewhere in your path.
   - documentation and examples, which go in an appropriate share
     directory, for example in /usr/local/share/doc

You can import the package as usual, by starting python and then
saying

    import p4


but my preferred way to use it is with the p4 script.  Using this
script at the command line starts python and loads in the package.
The advantage of using the p4 script is that you can read data files
from the command line.  To see if it is installed and works, try

    p4 --help

Documentation is at <http://p4.nhm.ac.uk>
